# DataScience
Data Science projects and applications.

# Summary
I created this repository to share some of the Data Science knowledge that I've been acquiring in my studies.

Each folder in this repository will contain a different project with a different problem approach.

## House Price Prediction

>In this notebook different models will be built to classify if a house costs over $220,000.
>
>All the **CRISP-DM methodology** will be applied as well as **pipelines for deployment**.
>
>Ensembling models will also be approached.

## Dimensionality Reduction

>In this notebook, dimensional reduction techniques are used to transform data from a high-dimensional
>space into a low-dimensional space so that the low-dimensional 
>representation retains some meaningful properties of the original data to be clusterized, easily spoted and processed.
